# Speedy-The-Turtle-Website
My personal website and blog.


This website is currently in its infancy. We will first start off with a very static site
and then will evolve it into something much nicer. Maybe I will play around with flask, jinja2
and SQLAlchemy (if I need a DB). Maybe I'll try playing around with react and some other fun things.

If this gets into being more of a webapp thing at some point I'll bring in some TDD and CI, probably
using Travis. That is not in the plans right now, just a thought.

### Expected Pages:
  * Home Page - About me
  * Resume
  * Games
  * Blog
